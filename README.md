# KMeans
K-means clustering on CBIR - Python

Instead of opting for text based conventional search engine which rely on caption or meta-data, a variety of appliations have chosen CBIR:
images on architectural design, medical diagnosis, crime prevention which is difficult to explain/search in mere words.

K-means clustering is hence used for image segmentation to describe the xyz% of colors present which is then used for histogram creation
(instead os using traditional masking)
